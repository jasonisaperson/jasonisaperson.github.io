To me what makes video games entertaining and fun is being competitive with friends and peers.Me personally I’m competitive in most thing sI do and video games is the cherry on top.Also when I want t o play by myself its entertaining because I get to play what I like.Sports games,shooting games etc.So its fun for me and very relaxing and unnerving.Also a great stress reliever for me.When I come home from school after i’ve done all of my homework on a friday afternoon I look forward to going on my game and playing it as well. </p>
    <p class="text_column">People like games because its fun,engaging,etc.but can also be addictive at times.Games model real world systems allowing players to be free and be allowed to do what they want which spells glee and happiness for most of the players </p>

To me, video games are such a powerful factor in today’s society because it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone.It’s diverse genre’’s of games can make it appealing to literally anyone. Another factor in why video games are so powerful is the competitiveness  it holds within it’s players.A
	adding a competitive edge brings a more professional view to the specific game and makes enjoyable content for twitch streamers and youtubers so others would get inspired to get better at said game. </p>

Nba 2k 22-rating-6/10
Graphics are great, and the different game modes are very diverse but when it comes to online play(Mypark),it can get a little annoying.With court glitches and build glitches it makes the game more and more enjoyable
madden 22-2/10
Its litteraly the same game every year with minor bug fixes and roster updates
wwe 2k22-9/10
Great game-play,excellent graphics and cool moves.Its reliability is sub par,(the games crashes from time to time) but its a really good game in my eyes. There's a little bugs that they need to fix though.</p>

My first game I ever played was fight night round 2.It was a boxing franchise that was critical to my childood which developed my love for fighting games nowadays like ufc and inustice,mortal kombat,street fighter etc..;</p>

The game that I might choose for the next project is fortnite   because there are tournaments all around the world for fortnite and large cash sums for the winner,so that would be interesting to research.</p>
	<p>9/1 How does your social media use affect how you feel?
It depends on what I see. I can see something that could piss me off, or I could see something that makes me laugh. It has minimal affect on me though. When i'm communicating with friends and they try to say something hurtful,i just say something back as a joke.
What conclusions can you draw from these statistics? People are connected to their friends using social media but some feel constant pressure from it
How do they compare to your personal experience? I connect with friends with social media,but im not overwhelmed by it. 
Some key takeaways from the video were that,sometimes social media has been associated with bad moods,and has been dated back to radios and televisions
This does compare to my experiences a little because sometimes social media has gotten on my nerves a little</p>

The game I will choose for the coaching project is super smash bros.I chose this game because it is interesting. What I already know about that game is that its hard to perfect the fundamentals of fighting. I need to learn how to fight consistently in super smash bros don't have any experience recording with obs.</p>
	  <p>9/14
The best move to me in super smash bros is the final touch by cloud and is the most useful to me.It is best because you can catch opponents off guard and can break combos with it,it can also kill early depending on the opponent you are facing.</p>

The main idea of this article is to show how much e sports has grown in this past year. It's important to know this information so you can see when e sorts peaks in popularity if you choose to join it. If i were to work in E sports I would be a strategist nor a content creator</p>
	<p>9/29


I think it takes lots of experience and patience to be a good coach in e sports. I Don't have much experience on the e sports platform, as I am only 15 years old, but patience is key to most game, and I think that I have that narrowed down.</p>

After gaming for  a while in the same chair, my derriere starts to hurt when I sit for too long and also when I game for too long, my eyes start to hurt a little. To deal with this, I just take a nap and all the pain goes away.</p>
