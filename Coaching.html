<p>Super smash bros: Age rated 8+  ESRB rating: T for teen
Description: Super smash bros. is a crossover fighting game series published by Nintendo. It was created by Masahiro Sakurai who has directed every game in the series.  The purpose for this page is for the new players that need to learn the nuances of the game before they move onto elite smash and maybe even entering tournaments. Little things that can help players gameplay is my goal to teach.</p>
		<p>The purpose for this page is for the new players that need to learn the nuances of the game before they move onto elite smash and maybe even entering tournaments. Little things that can help players gameplay is my goal to teach.
</p>
		<p>My personal favorite person to play in this game is cloud because of the possibilities of his move set as he acquires three new moves following his limit and and a medium weight character with decent damage. He also can kill pretty early with an up tilt and then the finishing touch.
</p>
		<p>Mechanics of super smash bros include; Punching, kicking, smash attacks ,tilts, moving, running ,jumping, and much more. The object of this game is to push players out of the ring with various attacks with specific characters to your choosing
</p>
		<p>One technique I use to enhance my game play in Super smash bros is called jab blocking.While you hit a heavy attack or an attack out of a grab, as they hit the ground, you can jab block them to keep them on the ground to set yourself up for a smash attack or a combo.It's moderately hard to master but when you do master it, you would be hard to beat.
</p>
		<p>Another technique that I use that are only specific to some characters like Kirby,meta knight,Mario,Falco, fox and much more is chain combos.  They are basically combos that are hard to escape  out of.  For example, if you get trapped in kirby's down air + up smash or up air or up tilt,that is part of a chain combo that can deal a lot of damage that could end in a  deadly smash attack. This is very hard to master but with enough training, it could prove decisive in elite smash.
</p>
		<p>One of the best techniques to use in Super Smash bros is called edge guarding,which is fairly easy to master since almost all characters has some form of edge guard.  Some examples are Fox, and Mewtwo with their down airs, or Pikachu with his down smash. My personal favorite edge guard to use is Ike's up B which is his Aether since the only way of escaping it is via air dodge which is highly readable and can set you op for a good up smash.
</p>
		<p>Another thing to keep in mind while playing Super Smash bros is opponents end frames. Players like Ike and Corrin and Cloud have A high end frame while completing their Up B which is highly punishable when dodged or missed.
</p>
		<p>One of the bests things to do  in hopes for an early kill to use to your advantage is using spikes. Some characters have very good spikes while some others is horrible. Characters like Ganondorf,King K rool, Ike, Captain Falcon, Dr Mario, and Donkey have great spikes while other characters like Pit,Sheik,Sonic, Samus,(hitbox),Corrin have bad spikes that usually end up in the characters killing their selves.
