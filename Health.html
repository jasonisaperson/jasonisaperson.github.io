      <h3>Health and Wellness&nbsp;</h3>
      <p>The article is about tips on healthy gamer habits to keep your life in check while you are gaming. Healthy habits that I already do is that I exercise and take breaks from gaming from time to time. At home I only game on the weekends so I can put my mind on better things like work, basketball, and school. What you can use for gaming behaviors is timers on how long you game for. I don't think its good for you to be gaming day and night. This is important to know if you are considering joining the esports field because it's important to regulate yourself so you don't live an unhealthy lifestyle. After gaming for a while in the same chair, my upper legs starts to hurt when I sit for too long and also when I game for too long, my eyes start to hurt a little. To deal with this, I just take a nap and all the pain go away. I agree with this list. Gaming has it's ups and downs. There are many negative effects to gaming, which is why it's important to game in moderation. Some things that I have learned with the interview with Ian Huston is wages being different for each player and how it varies. Some games pays more and some pays less. In order to be payed well, you need to be at the top of your game, which relates to real life if you want to make a considerable amount of money. Nothing comes easy. This is a great mindset to have coming out of high school and into your life. Some things that I have learned from the interview with Jon suh is that coaching makes a lot of players have more success. When a person is coached, they are more well groomed for their jobs, whereas players who are self taught are not as successful. Being coached is more preferable because it can give you a a lot of great results as long as yo u are willing to put in work. This connects to my life since I want to be coached for sports and maybe E-sports as well, and coaching will give me the best path. &nbsp;</p>
