To me what makes video games entertaining and fun is being competitive with friends and peers.Me personally I’m competitive in most thing sI do and video games is the cherry on top.Also when I want t o play by myself its entertaining because I get to play what I like.Sports games,shooting games etc.So its fun for me and very relaxing and unnerving.Also a great stress reliever for me.When I come home from school after i’ve done all of my homework on a friday afternoon I look forward to going on my game and playing it as well.</p>
      <p>People like games because its fun,engaging,etc.but can also be addictive at times.Games model real world systems allowing players to be free and be allowed to do what they want which spells glee and happiness for most of the players
</p>

To me, video games are such a powerful factor in today’s society because it can be enjoyed by virtually anyone.It’s diverse genre’’s of games can make it appealing to literally anyone. Another factor in why video games are so powerful is the competitiveness  it holds within it’s players.Adding a competitive edge brings a more professional view to the specific game and makes enjoyable content for twitch streamers and youtubers so others would get inspired to get better at said game.</p>

I normally game in my room on the tv or i game with my pc in my room also</p>

Nba 2k 22-rating-6/10
Graphics are great, and the different game modes are very diverse but when it comes to online play(Mypark),it can get a little annoying.With court glitches and build glitches it makes the game more and more enjoyable
madden 22-2/10
Its litteraly the same game every year with minor bug fixes and roster updates
wwe 2k22-9/10
Great game-play,excellent graphics and cool moves.Its reliability is sub par,(the games crashes from time to time) but its a really good game in my eyes. There's a little bugs that they need to fix though.

My first game I ever played was fight night round 2.It was a boxing franchise that was critical to my childood which developed my love for fighting games nowadays like ufc and inustice,mortal kombat,street fighter etc..;
</p>
		<p>8/26 about me unfinished
My story starts about when I was 4 years old. I was walking downstairs to my basement of my two story home in New Jersey where I lived for the first 15 years of my life. As I was saying, I was walking downstairs to my basement looking for my mom, and then at the corner of my eye,I peeped maybe the single most greatest boxing game  ever published, Fight Night 2. It was like love at first sight for me.
</p>

The game that I might choose for the next project is fortnite   because there are tournaments all around the world for fortnite and large cash sums for the winner,so that would be interesting to research.</p>
		<p>9/1 How does your social media use affect how you feel?
It depends on what I see. I can see something that could piss me off, or I could see something that makes me laugh. It has minimal affect on me though. When i'm communicating with friends and they try to say something hurtful,i just say something back as a joke.
What conclusions can you draw from these statistics? People are connected to their friends using social media but some feel constant pressure from it
How do they compare to your personal experience? I connect with friends with social media,but im not overwhelmed by it. 
Some key takeaways from the video were that,sometimes social media has been associated with bad moods,and has been dated back to radios and televisions
This does compare to my experiences a little because sometimes social media has gotten on my nerves a little
</p>
		<p>9/6
The game I will choose for the coaching project is super smash bros.I chose this game because it is interesting. What I already know about that game is that its hard to perfect the fundamentals of fighting. I need to learn how to fight consistently in super smash bros don't have any experience recording with obs.</p>
		<p>9/14
The best move to me in super smash bros is the final touch by cloud and is the most useful to me.It is best because you can catch opponents off guard and can break combos with it,it can also kill early depending on the opponent you are facing.</p>
		<p>9/21
The main idea of this article is to show how much e sports has grown in this past year. It's important to know this information so you can see when e sorts peaks in popularity if you choose to join it. If i were to work in E sports I would be a strategist nor a content creator
</p>
		<p>9/29


I think it takes lots of experience and patience to be a good coach in e sports. I Don't have much experience on the e sports platform, as I am only 15 years old, but patience is key to most game, and I think that I have that narrowed down.</p>
		<p>10/7

After gaming for  a while in the same chair, my derriere starts to hurt when I sit for too long and also when I game for too long, my eyes start to hurt a little. To deal with this, I just take a nap and all the pain goes away.</p>

		<p>  Super smash bros: Age rated 8+  ESRB rating: T for teen
Description: Super smash bros. is a crossover fighting game series published by Nintendo. It was created by Masahiro Sakurai who has directed every game in the series.  The purpose for this page is for the new players that need to learn the nuances of the game before they move onto elite smash and maybe even entering tournaments. Little things that can help players gameplay is my goal to teach.</p>
		<p>The purpose for this page is for the new players that need to learn the nuances of the game before they move onto elite smash and maybe even entering tournaments. Little things that can help players gameplay is my goal to teach.
</p>
		<p>My personal favorite person to play in this game is cloud because of the possibilities of his move set as he acquires three new moves following his limit and and a medium weight character with decent damage. He also can kill pretty early with an up tilt and then the finishing touch.
</p>
		<p>Mechanics of super smash bros include; Punching, kicking, smash attacks ,tilts, moving, running ,jumping, and much more. The object of this game is to push players out of the ring with various attacks with specific characters to your choosing
</p>
		<p>One technique I use to enhance my game play in Super smash bros is called jab blocking.While you hit a heavy attack or an attack out of a grab, as they hit the ground, you can jab block them to keep them on the ground to set yourself up for a smash attack or a combo.It's moderately hard to master but when you do master it, you would be hard to beat.
</p>
		<p>Another technique that I use that are only specific to some characters like Kirby,meta knight,Mario,Falco, fox and much more is chain combos.  They are basically combos that are hard to escape  out of.  For example, if you get trapped in kirby's down air + up smash or up air or up tilt,that is part of a chain combo that can deal a lot of damage that could end in a  deadly smash attack. This is very hard to master but with enough training, it could prove decisive in elite smash.
</p>
		<p>One of the best techniques to use in Super Smash bros is called edge guarding,which is fairly easy to master since almost all characters has some form of edge guard.  Some examples are Fox, and Mewtwo with their down airs, or Pikachu with his down smash. My personal favorite edge guard to use is Ike's up B which is his Aether since the only way of escaping it is via air dodge which is highly readable and can set you op for a good up smash.
</p>
		<p>Another thing to keep in mind while playing Super Smash bros is opponents end frames. Players like Ike and Corrin and Cloud have A high end frame while completing their Up B which is highly punishable when dodged or missed.
</p>
		<p>One of the bests things to do  in hopes for an early kill to use to your advantage is using spikes. Some characters have very good spikes while some others is horrible. Characters like Ganondorf,King K rool, Ike, Captain Falcon, Dr Mario, and Donkey have great spikes while other characters like Pit,Sheik,Sonic, Samus,(hitbox),Corrin have bad spikes that usually end up in the characters killing their selves.

		<h3>Health and wellness</h3>
	  <p>The article is about tips on healthy gamer habits to keep your life in check while you are gaming. Healthy habits that I already do is that I exercise and take breaks from gaming from time to time. At home I only game on the weekends so I can put my mind on better things  like work, basketball, and school. What you can use for gaming behaviors is timers on how long you game for. I don't think its good for you to be gaming day and night. This is important to know if you are considering joining the esports field because it's important to regulate yourself so you don't live an unhealthy lifestyle.

After gaming for  a while in the same chair, my upper legs starts to hurt when I sit for too long and also when I game for too long, my eyes start to hurt a little. To deal with this, I just take a nap and all the pain go away.


I agree with this list. Gaming has it's ups and downs. There are many negative effects to gaming, which is  why it's important to game in moderation.


Some things that I have learned with the interview with Ian Huston is wages being different for each player and how it varies. Some games pays more and some pays less. In order to be payed well, you need to be at the top of your game, which relates to real life if you want to make a considerable amount of money. Nothing comes easy. This is a great mindset to have coming out of high school and into your life.
 
Some things that I have learned from the interview with Jon suh is that coaching makes a lot of players have more success. When a person is coached, they are more well groomed for their jobs, whereas players who are self taught are not as successful. Being coached is more preferable because it can give you a a lot of great results as long as yo u are willing to put in work. This connects to my life since I want to be coached for sports and maybe E-sports as well, and coaching will give me the best path.

		<h3>ABout me</h3>
		<p>My story starts about when I was 4 years old. I was walking downstairs to my basement of my two story home in New Jersey where I lived for the first 15 years of my life. As I was saying, I was walking downstairs to my basement looking for my mom, and then at the corner of my eye,I peeped maybe the single most greatest boxing game  ever published, Fight Night 2. It was like love at first sight for me. That was the first video game I every played on the PlayStation 2.5 game consoles that influenced my past was PlayStation 2,PlayStation,PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox 360. 3 games that are my favorite is,call of duty,2k, and shinobi striker. Three games that I am excited for is, mulitiversus,nba 2k23 and fifa 23
</p>
		
		<p>I put a picture of the PS2 because it is the first gaming console that I have ever played on, and where I had my first gaming experiences but I remember little to none about the games that was on it because I was so young
Call of duty and NBA2k23  are the two games that I really want to play as of right now. I already have Call of duty, now I just have to get NBA 2k23 so I can complete my gaming experiences so far.
The most recent gaming experience I have had is with the PS5. I have played games like Naruto shin obi striker, NBA 2k22, fortnite, and FIFA.</p>
	  <p>I will say that the xbox series x is very good as well. Gams like Forza, nba, fifa, madden, and roblox run very smoothly on it. But ultimately, I like the PS5 better but it is very close.
