	  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>My story starts about when I was 4 years old. I was walking downstairs to my basement of my two story home in New Jersey where I lived for the first 15 years of my life. As I was saying, I was walking downstairs to my basement looking for my mom, and then at the corner of my eye,I peeped maybe the single most greatest boxing game  ever published, Fight Night 2. It was like love at first sight for me. That was the first video game I every played on the PlayStation 2.5 game consoles that influenced my past was PlayStation 2,PlayStation,PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox 360. 3 games that are my favorite is,call of duty,2k, and shinobi striker. Three games that I am excited for is, mulitiversus,nba 2k23 and fifa 23
</p>
		
		<p>I put a picture of the PS2 because it is the first gaming console that I have ever played on, and where I had my first gaming experiences but I remember little to none about the games that was on it because I was so young
Call of duty and NBA2k23  are the two games that I really want to play as of right now. I already have Call of duty, now I just have to get NBA 2k23 so I can complete my gaming experiences so far.
The most recent gaming experience I have had is with the PS5. I have played games like Naruto shin obi striker, NBA 2k22, fortnite, and FIFA.</p>
	  <p>I will say that the xbox series x is very good as well. Gams like Forza, nba, fifa, madden, and roblox run very smoothly on it. But ultimately, I like the PS5 better but it is very close.
